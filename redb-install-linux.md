# Linux installation quick guide (TO-BE-UPDATED)


This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing software on Linux systems. The steps below are suitable for most open-source projects and can be adapted for your specific software.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS)
- Terminal access with sudo privileges
- Internet connection

## 1. Update Your System

Before installing new software, update your package index to ensure you have the latest information:

```bash
sudo apt update        # For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
sudo dnf check-update  # For Fedora-based systems
```


## 2. Install Dependencies

Check your software’s documentation for any required dependencies. Install them using your package manager. For example:

```bash
sudo apt install  
```


## 3. Download the Software

Clone the repository or download the release package:

- **Clone via Git:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
  cd your-repo
  ```
- **Download a Release:**
  - Download the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file from the Releases page.
  - Extract it:
    ```bash
    tar -xzf your-software.tar.gz
    cd your-software
    ```


## 4. Build and Install

If your software requires compilation (from source):

1. **Read the README and INSTALL files** for specific instructions.
2. **Typical build steps:**
   ```bash
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   ```
   - Some projects use `cmake` or other build systems; adjust accordingly.

## 5. Install via Package Manager (If Available)

If your software is available in your distribution’s repositories, you can install it directly:

- **Debian/Ubuntu:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install 
  ```
- **Fedora:**
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install 
  ```


## 6. Verify Installation

Check that the software is installed and accessible:

```bash
 --version
```
or
```bash
which 
```
